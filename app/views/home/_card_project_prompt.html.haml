            %p Once Loose Ends receives your project submission, we will look through our database of finishers to find a good match. With considerations to geography, craft, skill level, and preferences, we will identify a good fit based on the information volunteer finishers submitted in their profiles.
            %p After we identify a good finisher for you, we will offer them details about your project and wait for their reply. Once they agree to the job, we will introduce you in an email. Thanks for trusting Loose Ends with your precious handwork. We'll be in touch soon.
