Hello,
As part of your enablement of AWS Cost Explorer, we have configured AWS
Cost Anomaly Detection for your account. Cost Anomaly Detection is a cost
management service that helps you reduce cost surprises and enhance control
without slowing innovation. It uses advanced machine learning models to
detect and alert on anomalous spend patterns across your deployed AWS
services. The cost monitor and daily email alert subscription we set up for
you are free. You can change the default configuration via our console or
API to customize the alerts you receive. You can also configure immediate
alerts via SNS, though additional charges for using SNS may apply.
To get you started with AWS Cost Anomaly Detection, we pre-configured your
account with an AWS Services monitor
<https://1hglkcb3.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon=

c9699c9-000000/PXmG2c5q-tAKid7mGA-AipBYmtg=3D416>
and a daily summary alerting subscription

367fec9699c9-000000/il7Q-sEiOFH7TqcGxreGQcJs2ME=3D416>.
With this setup, you will be alerted about anomalous spend that exceeds
$100 and 40% of your expected spend across the majority of your AWS
services in your accounts. See limitations here
<https://1hglkcb3.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fdocs.aws.amazon.co=

Q: What is Cost Anomaly Detection?
Cost Anomaly Detection is an AWS cost management service that monitors
customers=E2=80=99 spend continuously, uses machine learning to detect anom=
alies,
and generates alerts with root cause analysis of what caused the anomaly.
With the service, you can reduce unplanned spend and minimize time and
resources in triaging root causes. You can read more about the service on
our product page

There is no charge for Cost Anomaly Detection. The cost monitor and daily
email alert subscription we set up for you are free. You can change the
default configuration via our console or API to customize the alerts you
receive. You can also configure immediate alerts via SNS, though additional
charges for using SNS may apply.
Q: What type of anomalies will Cost Anomaly Detection detect?
With the default setup, Cost Anomaly Detection will monitor costs on the
majority of your AWS services in your accounts. See limitations here
<https://1hglkcb3.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fdocs.aws.amazon.co=

OAeVwbf9kKXvAzLpKc=3D416>.

Q: How will I be alerted about anomalies?
Any anomalous spend related to your account(s) will show up in the Cost
Anomaly Detection console and via the API. In addition, if the anomaly is
above $100 and exceeds 40% of expected spend, you will receive a daily
summary email to the primary email associated with your account, detailing
the cost impact, account name, the name of the monitor, the start and end
dates, and the service where it was observed. The email will also include
potential root causes for the anomaly.
Q: How do I opt out?
If you are not interested in this service, you can opt-out by deleting your
monitor(s) and subscription(s) in the console

Q: What happens if I opt out? Can I still enable Cost Anomaly Detection at
a later date?
Yes, if you decide to opt out now, you will still be able to enable Cost
Anomaly Detection at a later time. When you opt out, you will still be able
to use Cost Explorer without Cost Anomaly Detection.
